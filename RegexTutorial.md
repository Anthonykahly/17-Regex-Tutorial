# 17-Regex-Tutorial

Regular expressions (Regex) is sometimes also referred to as rational expression, and is a sequence of characters that specifies and matches patterns within text. Regex are used often in the coding workspace to validate specific inputs. In this assignment I will be using Regex to match character information for validating email addresses.

# Summary

The code we will be summarizing today is: `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`

## Anchors

Anchors are complicated in the world of Regex, as they dont match any real characters. What anchors do however is ensure that regex matches a string to a specific place, usually the beginning or end of a coding line. The anchors used to contain this email Regex are: `^` to start, and `$` to finish.
